	<p>A Data model is a tree of elements organized in a hierarchy of
		schema --&gt; tables --&gt; fields.</p>

	<p>
		A schema is a collection of named <a href="Table.html">tables</a>.
		Each table is a ordered collection of named fields. Each field belongs
		to a database type and has other properties.
	</p>

	<p>
		The schema is modeled as a tree of <a href="SchemaElement.html">SchemaElelemnt</a>
		where each element is named and contained in another element.
	</p>

	<p>
		Creating a schema with its element is defined by <a
			href="SchemaBuilder.html">SchemaBuilder</a> interface.
	</p>

	<p>
		A schema can be created either in memory or from information from
		database. The concrete derivation of <a href="SchemaBuilder.html">SchemaBuilder</a>
		may access specific underlying database to build a schema.
	</p>

	<p>A in-memory schema builder is available in this package that
		builds a schema from JSON descriptor.</p>
