 * A basic element in {@link Datamodel}. A schema element has a {@link Named
 * name} and often owned by a {@link SchemaContainer container element}.
 * 
 * <br>
 * Schema forms a <em>closed</em> group. If an element <code>a</code> in a
 * schema refers to another element <code>b</code>, then <code>b</code> also
 * belongs to same schema. <br>
 * For example, a {@link Field field} of {@link Index index} is owned by a
 * {@link Table table}, which in turn, owned by a {@link Schema schema}. <br>
 * Fully connected schema implies that all references in a schema are resolved
 * in the schema itself. <br>
 * For example, a {@link Table#getPrimaryKeys() primary key} of a table may
 * have multiple {@link FieldGroup#getFields() fields}. The fields of a primary
 * key must also be resolved in the same table
