### View table creation DDL for a particular table

- Right-click the target table and select **View Table DDL**.
- Table creation DDL is displayed in a separate window, which also includes an option to copy the DDL.

### Create child tables

1. Right-click the target table and select **Create Child Table**
2. You can create the child table in two ways:

   - **Simple DDL Input** : You can use this mode to create the child table declaratively, that is, without writing a DDL statement.
   - **Advanced DDL Input** : You can use this mode to create the child table using a DDL statement.

3. Click **Create**.

### Work with complex data types such as Array, Maps, Record and JSON

- Perform DDL and DML operations for these data types and also create indexes.
- The complex data types are only supported through DDL and DML statements.

### Work with the binary and fixed binary data types

1. Create a table with **Binary** and **Fixed Binary** data types columns in it.
2. Right-click the target table and select insert row.
3. You can insert data in binary or fixed binary column in three ways :

   - **Direct input in TextField** : You can use this mode to insert data in binary column in Base64 format.
   - **Through file** : You can use this mode to open a prompt and select a .bin file to be inserted in the column.
   - **Advance input:JSON Schema** : You can insert the complete row in the table through advance input.

4. Click on **Insert**.
5. The table view of the binary and fixed binary column does not display the inserted text or file.
6. Instead of text, there is an option called **Download Binary Object**, which allows the user to download the binary object in .bin format to local storage and view its contents using any .bin editor.
7. A prompt appears asking the user to choose a location to download the binary object. The user can select the desired location and click **OK**.
8. A IntelliJ notification appears with one-click link to open the downloaded .bin file.

### Full schema renderer for the Map, Array, Record, Binary, Fixed Binary and Index in the NoSQL tool window tree

- Full detailed schema of the data type will be displayed in the NoSQL tool window tree.

### Global Active Tables for Cloud

[Basic Global Active Tables concepts](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/nosql-database/doc/basic-concepts.html)

1. Connect to a cloud connection.
2. Create a table (One column must be of JSON type).
3. [Freeze/Unfreeze the table](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/nosql-cloud/yooud/index.html#GUID-54C067AF-D099-42D8-817F-A62E31992E20__FR_UNFR_SCHEMA) 
4. The Global Active Table provides support for :
   - Add Replica
   - View Replicas
   - Drop Replicas
- Reference : [Manage regional replicas](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/nosql-cloud/yooud/index.html#GUID-54C067AF-D099-42D8-817F-A62E31992E20__MNG_REP)

### Multi-Region Tables for On-prem

1. Set up the multiple kvstore and proxy.
2. [Set up the Multi-region environment](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/other-databases/nosql-database/24.4/admin/use-case-1-set-multi-region-environment.html)
3. Use the plugin to create and manage the table and regions.
4. The above task can be achieved by **Execute DDL** option present in the NoSQL tool window.

### Execute System Requests for the On-prem connections

- System Request is an on-premise-only request used to perform any table-independent administrative operation such as create/drop of namespaces and security-relevant operations (create/drop users and roles). These operations are asynchronous and completion needs to be checked.

- Examples of statements used in this object include:

  - CREATE NAMESPACE mynamespace
  - CREATE USER some_user IDENTIFIED BY password
  - CREATE ROLE some_role
  - GRANT ROLE some_role TO USER some_user

- This request can be executed by using the **Execute DDL** option present in the NoSQL tool window.

### Edit provisioned capacity of the cloud tables

- [Edit provisioned capacity](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/nosql-cloud/yooud/index.html#GUID-54C067AF-D099-42D8-817F-A62E31992E20__EDIT_RES_CAP)

### Use namespace support for On-prem connections

- The namespace support is now available in the plugin.
- The namespaces can be created from the **Execute DDL** option present in the NoSQL tool window.
  More information on namespace :  [Oracle NoSQL Database Namespaces](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/other-databases/nosql-database/24.4/java-driver-table/introducing-namespaces.html)
- While adding an On-prem connection, enter a namespace in the Namespace field.
- Fill the created namespace to set up a connection to a particular namespace under particular kvstore connection.
- Once connected to this connection, it will list all the tables under that namespace.

### Json Collection Tables

- To Create a new Json Collection Table :

   1. Hover over the database where you want to add the new table.
   2. Right click on the connection name and select **Create Table**.
   3. In the table creation mode, select **For Advanced DDL input**
   4. Supply the valid DDL statement for creating Json Collection table in the query box to create the table.

- To Insert a row in Json Collection Table :

   1. Right-click the target table and select **Insert Row**.
   3. You can INSERT a new ROW in only one mode : **Advanced JSON Input**
   4. Supply a valid Json string corresponding to a row in the Json Collection table in the text box.
   5. Click **Insert Row**.

- To Update a single row :

   1. Right-click on the target row. A context-menu appears.
   2. Select **Update Row** where you can only update in **For Advanced DDL input** mode.
   3. In the Json input, supply the Json string corresponding to the updated row to update a row.

- To create index :

   1. Right-click the target table and select **Create Index**.
   2. You can add index in only one mode : **Advanced DDL Input**
   3. Supply a valid DDL statement in the text box.
   4. Click **Create Index**.

- Rest everything can be used in the same manner as a normal table.

### MR Counters

- To use MR Counters, first we have to create a multi region table by selecting **Advanced DDL input** in the table creation mode and supplying a valid DDL statement with MR Counters.
- For inserting a new row, insert as usual ensuring that it contains all the MR Counter fields.
- For Updating a particular row containing MR Counter :

   1. Right-click on the target row. A context-menu will appear.
   2. Select **Update Row**.
   3. In both the input modes namely Simple DDL input and Advanced DDL input, you have to increment or decrement all the MR Counters as :
      - For Simple DDL input with non JSON fields, increment or decrement MR Counter fields as "<mrCounterName> +/- <value>"
      - For Json fields in Simple DDL input option containing nested MR Counters or Advanced DDL input option, increment or decrement MR Counters in the Json string as "<mrCounterName>" = "<mrCounterName> +/- <value>"

### Composite Primary Key

- While creating a table, you can create a composite primary key :

   1. **Simple DDL input**
      - Click the **Add Primary Key Column** button to add more fields to the primary key.

   2. **Advanced DDL input**
      - Supply a valid DDL statement to create a table with composite primary keys.

- To view the fields that makes up a composite primary key :

   1. Click the target table to see the listed columns, Primary Keys, Indexes and Shard Keys.
   2. Click the Primary key and a list of columns making the primary key appears.

### View Index DDL

1. Click the target table to see the listed columns, Primary Keys, Indexes and Shard Keys.
2. Locate the target-index and right-click on it.
3. Click **View Index DDL**.
4. Index creation DDL will be displayed in another window which also has a option to copy the DDL.
